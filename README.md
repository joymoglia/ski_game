## Overview of Program:

The purpose of the game is to ski down the mountain. You begin each game with a healthscore of 100. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the player. Catch flags to gain flag points. Colliding with trees and snowballs will reduce your health score. The game will restart when your health score reaches zero, while tracking your highest flag score. 

## Instruction

1. Download all files from Github
2. Use terminal to run **python game.py**
3. The game will start automatically
4. For game instructions, refer to **instructions.txt** 

Key Commands:
    [<] = ski left
    [<<] = accelerate left
    [>] = ski right
    [>>] = accelerate right

## Reflection

I chose this project to learn Pygame and animation concepts, and I specifically wanted to create a ski game since I love to ski! I initially envisioned creating a game that had different levels, but learning Pygame and animation was time-consuming so I ended up creating a simpler game similar to Ski Free from the 90s. I used online resources like Google, Youtube, and Stackoverflow to learn Pygame, and I documented what I learned in a file called **"Pygame_Research_Notes.pdf"**.  

I initially coded the game without using Classes. This enabled me to practice basic animation concepts quickly, get the game up and running faster, and learn how key variables interacted with each other. However, converting the code into Classes at the end was time consuming and required a lot of de-bugging. I also had to create my own ski icons, since the ones I found online were copyrighted. The code for detecting collisions was surprisingly difficult. And the "Welcome Screen" was a last minute add-on that could certainly be improved upon.

Overall, learning Pygame was extremely time consuming but also rewarding. I really enjoyed learning about animation and Pygame, tinkering with the code, designing the icons, finding a cool soundtrack, and putting it all together. I really enjoyed this project, especially the part where I get to play the game!
